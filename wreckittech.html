      <h2>Twas the Hack Before Christmas</h2>
      <h5>December 6, 2018 by Skylar Barrowman</h5>
      <div class="blogimg2"></div>
      <p></p>
      <p>Twas the Hack before Christmas when all through the office
No employee was stirring, not even an analyst;
The laptops were sleeping by monitors with care,
In hopes that hackers would come nowhere near there;
The children were nestled all snug in their beds;
While visions of V-Bucks danced in their heads;
Customer Success ends a shift with their coats in their hands,
With hopes for a holiday without any scams.</p>

      <p> When out on the internet there arose such a Hacker,
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the ZeroFOX Platform I flew like a flash,
Tore open the Laptop and threw up the dash (board).
The light of my old Macbook Air screen,
Gave a luster of Alerts with content offensive and mean,
When what to my wondering eyes did appear,
A Hacker posting on eight social networks I fear,
With a little profanity so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment he must be Hacker St. Nick.

</p>
      <p> More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he tapped, and pounded, and called the networks by name:
“Now, Facebook! now, Twitter! And Instagram too!
On, LinkedIn! on, Slack! And onto YouTube!
More likes and more comments and posts on the wall!
Now hack away! hack away! hack away all!”</p>
      <p> As alerts came in so swift and so fast,
I knew just the solution this St. Nick would never outlast;
So up to the ZeroFOX Castle I went
To stop Hacker Nicholas and his malicious intent—</p>

      <p>And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the keep
The prancing and pawing of Hacker Nick’s feet.
With each alert reviewed, triaged, and escalated,
Hacker St. Nicholas became more frustrated
He was dressed all in Code, from his toes to his lashes,
And his Code was all tarnished with meta and Hashes;
A bundle of impersonations he’d flung on his back,
From the profiles he’d stolen, the accounts that he’d hacked. </p>

      <p> His profile picture gave me a pause
To an unsuspecting viewer, he’d look just like Santa Claus!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the mask on his face was as white as the snow;
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke, it encircled his head like a <>;</p>

      <p> But to my trained eye, I knew him a fraud
He thought he had planned, but his plan was quite flawed
He never expected ZeroFOX to find
Block and hide all his posts in real-time
I removed malicious comments and phishing links too
I knew there was only one thing left to do </p>

      <p>I proceeded to expose him and take down the imposter
Saving Christmas was important to CEO Foster!
With my finger on the mouse, I gave one more click
And said a final goodbye to the fake St. Nick
In that moment, I did what he had long feared
I requested a takedown and he disappeared;
But I heard him exclaim, as his profile came down—
“ZeroFOX offers the best digital risk protection in town!” </p>

      <h2>Copy and Paste: The surface webs black market</h2>

      <h2>What happened to my Spotify Account: Part I </h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>Ever ask yourself why does it look like someone has been using my Hulu or Spotify account. No its not a old girlfriend or college roommate or even your sister. Its the Hacker next door. Your probably wondering what is this guy talking about? What is the surface web? It has a black market? I have a hacker next door? First you need to know the definition of Copy and Paste.</p>
      <p>Copy is the act of duplicating text, data, files, or disks, producing two or more of the same file or segments of data.</p>
      <p> While Paste is an operating system and programs action that allows you to copy an object or text from one location and place it to another location. For example, you could copy a URL sent to you by a friend in Facebook message, Slack, or over an Tweet and paste that URL into a web browser to visit the web page. You could also copy and paste information from a database you have just hacked into or a malicious web page url.</p>
      

<p> Fun fact: Often when online services are compromised, the first signs of it appear on "paste" sites. Attackers frequently publish either samples or complete dumps of compromised data on these services. Monitoring and reporting on the presence of email addresses on the likes can give impacted users a head start on mitigating the potential fallout from a breach.</p>


<p> So what does Copy and Paste have to do with the surface webs black market? This is exactly it Attackers/Hackers love to acquire certain information "cough cough" private information such as credit card information and Copy and Paste them to "paste" sites and sell them most times for just under 20$ US. You don't even have to have an account on most of the sites. You can just go to the search bar and type credit cards for sale or even Facebook username and passwords to Free V-bucks and see 100's of 1000's of pastes attempting to sell stolen information, Social media accounts, and even in game currency for games like Fortnite and Apex legends.</p>
<p> All this information can be found on The surface web. The surface web is pretty much anything that you are able to google, bing, duck duck and go to. Why am I informing you besides being a all around good person my Fiancee's Spotify and Hulu information was recently in a breach and posted to the world for sale and it was actually purchased and used. Little to say she was not happy and also unaware of paste sites even though I have mentioned them many times before.</p>
<p>Should people be just as aware of these sites as they are there social media? Stay tuned for the next installment of Copy and Paste: The surface webs black market to find out What Happened to my Fiancee's Spotify account. Did we find the perp? How many sites was the information on? How much did the info sell for? Did we get the postings removed?<p>

      <h2>What The Hack: Leaks, breaches and what to do when you get hacked</h2>
      <h5>February 14, 2019 by Skylar Barrowman</h5>
      <div class="blogimg"></div>
      <p></p>
      <p>Hi everyone! I am Skylar, your ZeroFOX Analyst, bringing you all the data breaches and data leaks in one single read. Welcome to What The Hack!, a new blog series that serves as the go-to resource for updates on data breaches and leaked information (with a little humor mixed in too).</p>
      <p>To kick off this series, I want to tell you a story. Believe it or not, even the professionals are affected by breaches and leaks. Case and point: the email I used when I was in high school was involved in a data breach. Thankfully, it was one I had used for job interviews and not the one I created for Myspace because this article would be way more embarrassing if that was the case. In this post, we’ll walk through the difference between a breach and a leak, how you can identify if you’ve been part of a breach, and what you can do to prevent involvement in future breaches.</p>
      <h4> WHAT THE HACK IS A LEAK?</h4>
      <p> What is a leak?  A leak is the effect of a widespread issue resulting in misconfigured databases that are easily searchable on Google or through other extremely accessible tools. In other cases, though, leaks are the direct result of how a service is intended to function. Ready for a fun fact? In all states, by law companies must disclose data breaches. However, when it comes to leaks, these laws can be hard to enforce. For one, disclosure requires acknowledgment and awareness of an issue, but in many cases, knowledge of leaks comes from third-party security professionals and sometimes whistleblowers.</p>
      <h4> WHAT THE HACK IS A BREACH?
</h4>

<p> What is a breach? Data breaches are intrusions into sensitive systems by a hacker(s) or unauthorized user. So unlike a leak, a breach means that someone is actively trying to pursue the affected data. Hackers aiming to conduct data breaches often rely on methods such as SQL injection, Cross site scripting, and Clickjacking. Social media is one of the easiest ways for these hackers to access your data. They do so through impersonating accounts, malicious links (often sent through direct messages), and other phishing attempts. But they don’t stop at social media. They even try to use your favorite video game, Fortnite, creating fake websites and social media campaigns to get you to give up your credentials, credit card numbers and personal information.</p>

<h4> WHAT THE BREACH!
</h4>
<p> Now that we know the difference between a breach and a leak, I’m going to tell you how my own email address was in a breach and what I did about it.</p>
<p> I was informed through the ZeroFOX Platform that my email address was part of a TicketFly breach that affected approximately 26,151,608 users. The breach affected not only email addresses but names, phone numbers and physical addresses as well.</p>
<p>1. Change your password and make it strong.
2. Don’t choose a password you use for other sites. This makes it easier for hackers to access your accounts.
3. Always use Two-Factor Authentication when available.<p>

<p> Now that you’ve heard my own experience, I hope you will continue to read future installments of What the Hack! I will be bringing you breaches and leaks as they are found with key information and steps to take after you are affected. If you would like to get real time alerts like the one above when you are affected by a breach or leak, contact my team at ZeroFOX.</p>
