  <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
  <p><em>I LOVE TO CODE!</em></p>
  <p>I might be new to the game but I know how to work hard. A little bit about myself. I am a Combat Veteran. I have been in two military branches and I have worked for the leader in social media security Zerofox since 2017. I started as a platform operator and moved my way on up to a platform specialist. If my time in the military taught me anything is that anyone can learn and do anything as long as you put your mind to it and work hard. Think about it they give an 18-year-old kid whos never been to college a gun to go fight in a war far away from home. They give another 18-year-old kid a toolbox and say fix this helicopter. The kid with the rifle is about to get on it and we want to make sure it is maintained correctly before it flies over the deserts of Afghanistan. They give another kid a medkit and say I need you to get on the helicopter that the kid just fixed to give medical attention to the kid with the rifle if anything happens to him. If this does not tell you that people are capable of anything with a little bit of training and hard work I don't know what will. This is the mentality I bring into work every day eager to learn more about Software and how to develop processes to help with pain points. I LOVE automation. </p>

  <h3>Highlights</h3>
  <h3>Fortnite Scam Research</h3>
  
  <div>
  <p> - Fortnite has 43 million players and growing (based on Jan 2018 figures)</p>
  <p> - Fortnite is making an estimated $300 million per month on in-game purchases</p>
  <p>- Over a one month period from early September to early October 2018, me and my team at Zerofox has generated over 53,000 alerts related to Fortnite scams.</p>
  <p>- The majority of these alerts, 86%, were generated from social media, with 11% coming from web domains and a little over 2% coming from Youtube. Over 4,770 live domains related to fortnite and vbuck scams We found over 1,390 youtube videos with millions of views combined</p>
  <p>- The ZeroFOX platform has generated 100s of alerts every day on social media posts with links to a single Fortnite scam website, fortnite-gifts.</p>
  <p>- Considering the scope and reach of these scams and the average age of Fortnite players, understanding what these scams are, where they occur and how users can protect themselves is critical.
